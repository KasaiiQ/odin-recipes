    <h3>
        Directions
    </h3>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <strong>
            Step1 
        </strong>
        <br>
        <p>Heat olive oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and <br>
            mushrooms. Sprinkle with salt. Cook and stir until mushrooms release all of <br>
            their liquid and start to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in bell peppers and <br>
            jalapeno pepper. Cook and stir until peppers begin to soften up, about 5 <br>
            minutes. Season with cumin, paprika, turmeric, black pepper, and cayenne. Stir <br>
            and cook to "wake up" the flavors, about 1 minute. Pour in crushed tomatoes <br>
            and water. Adjust heat to medium and simmer uncovered until veggies are <br>
            softened and sweet, stirring occasionally, 15 to 20 minutes. Add more water if <br>
            sauce becomes too thick <br>
        </p>
        <strong>
            Step2 
        </strong>
        <br>
        <p>
            Make a depression in the sauce for each egg with a large spoon. Crack egg into a <br>
            small ramekin and slide gently into each indentation; repeat with the rest of the <br>
            eggs. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and cook until eggs are to your desired doneness <br>
        </p>

        <strong>
            Step3 
        </strong>
        <br>
        
        Top with feta cheese and parsley <br>

    </ol>
